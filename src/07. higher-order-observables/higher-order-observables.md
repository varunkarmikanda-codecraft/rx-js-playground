## Higher order observables

An observable that emits observables is known as a `Higher order observable`.

## Creating a higher order observable

We can quickly create a higher oder observabe by using a creational operator and then pipe on the resultant observable with a map operator, that transforms the values into observables.

```typescript
Observable<Observable<number>>
```
